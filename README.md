# C++-Proxy-For-Debian-Ubuntu
This is the C++ version of my previous Proxy Changing App done using Java.
With this you can choose to run as <b>sudo</b> and it will run with no need for the mint-proxy-on script(optional).

This is first full upload including code, open for anyone to fork and edit. Please Enjoy and post and recomendations to change of code.

The excecutable is in the /bin directory for those who mind compiling the source.
Thank YOU.
